407,7: what can not be used in object names.
574,Some background on this: C++ supports multiple inheritance  but C# does not. Multiple inheritance in C++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. C# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. Although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.

They will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. They will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! What I felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. In this round they will not assess our Communication skills or Management Skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. For us the topic was ""Procedural Oriented Vs Object Oriented"". I initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. Somehow I tried to convey the things that I know and actively participated in the discussion. After 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. Now  we should be very careful. We should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people. I confidently discussed with my competitors and somehow qualified in the second round."

571,Abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. They are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. One key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. A class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. Abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. They also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.

1072,In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach. This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JIT-compiled and run on any supported architecture.

1125,Let us think you have marked the answer for a question while the timer is at 00:10 seconds(10 seconds remaining) then please don't get panicked/tensed. Once you marked the answer before 2.15 minutes the answer will be automatically saved. If you click on NEXT option on the screen before 2.15 minutes then it will display you the next question and if you don't wish to do so then you have a buffer time of 30 seconds after which the next question will be displayed so you can feel relaxed for a moment(DO NOT FOLLOW THIS FOR EVERY QUESTION).  This helped me personally.

1712,The key to crack this round is also you already know.. ;) but still  will mention it. Confidence. Eye contact while communicating in group
1261,****N.B*** Never try to attempt the Sec-3 first(the Staff present there wud persuade u to do it first in order to secure gud marks)  try the other two sections first then return bck to Sec-3 if time permits.
1029,25. cache access time 100 msec. main memory access time 800 msec if the hit ratio is 95%   what is mean access time ...
1701,Me:: (I said a small ex  like this... i showed the door beside me and said like this..) Theif will unlock the door without exact key. and if that thief is given a chance to prepare the lock and key  he will do it perfectly in such a way that  no other theif can unlock it. Just like that if a tester comes to development and writes a code  the code will be in such a way that no other tester can find any bugs in it. So that way i can be a good developer  even though i ma with 1.5 yrs expereienced in testing and away from development.

We were given the topic ""INTERNET USAGE AMONG CHILDREN"" it is quite easy topic so I thought that I can definitely clear this round. After 2 minutes of brainstorming about the topic monitor asked us to start the discussion  one of my friend took initiative and started the discussion I was really waiting for chance as soon as she completed almost 3 to 4 members of my friends started arguing  being as a girl I don't have a loud voice  I was really disappointed that why am I not delivering even though I have valid points 3 minutes passed away discussion turned out very clumsy and I didn't even speak for once I was actually broken that  everyone was shouting as it is very easy topic panel member was really annoyed with our discussion after few seconds I realized one thing and shouted as much as I can ""GUYS  THIS IS A GROUP DISCUSSION NOT A DEBATE"" everyone was so calm monitor was bit happy and again they started shouting as we are running out of time I concluded the discussion. After 6 minutes of discussion everyone are supposed to give self introduction and speak 1 min of their own topic individually. On the spot he announced the result 9 members got selected for technical HR and I was one among them. Key point to remember to clear GD is Be confident  speak authoritatively and politely  must and make an eye contact with your friends. These are enough to clear GD."

397,We must be able to create a after row trigger on table (i.e.  it should be not be already available) After giving table privileges. We cannot specify snapshot log name because oracle uses the name of the master table in the name of the database objects that support its snapshot log. The master table name should be less than or equal to 23 characters. (The table name created will be MLOGS_tablename  and trigger name will be TLOGS name).
1197,"I've said as follows in Deloitte interview - ""When I was in 12th standard  my father again joined our family and did all those things in order to distract me from getting high score in 12th and he has openly said about that too.

446,C is an objective oriented language - yes or no?
358,A record group is an internal Oracle Forms data structure that has a column/row framework similar to a database table. However  unlike database tables  record groups are separate objects that belong to the form module in which they are defined. A record group can have an unlimited number of columns of type CHAR  LONG  NUMBER  or DATE provided that the total number of columns does not exceed 64K. Record group column names cannot exceed 30 characters.
2333,For long transactions that contain many SQL statements  intermediate markers or savepoints can be declared which can be used to divide a transaction into smaller parts.

1433,a.  A public key     b.  A private key     c.  B public key     d.  B private key
2411,So  one must be through with all the java concepts because it also helps a lot during interview because VIRTUSA interviews are done mainly on JAVA. Coming to DBMS  the questions are related to SQL queries. Some bits are from Data Structures like stacks and queues.  There is a less focus on software testing  but basics should be clear and we have to know about types of testing and by whom the testing's are done in real world. The time given for these 40 questions is 40 minutes.
309,a rating method  appraising mangers against verifiable objectives a ranking method  appraising managers as managers

1553,In this  there were to rounds in which a common GD on a topic and 2nd was speaking on anything interesting and worth sharing for 40-45 secs. The key here is to only talk in English and talk to the point and the topic chosen by you should be rich  not common like cricket. 8 Cleared the GD round.
1810,Multiple database support : Oracle has a superior ability to manage multiple databases within the same transaction using a two-phase commit protocol.
999,The result was declared on 10th of august and the interview was scheduled on 31 october.
480,7. He asked about inheritance  polymorphism  abstration encapsulation  etc...
413,"PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts. Just be careful  there is no ""decode"" command available."
268,Objects from unsigned CLR assemblies with EXTERNAL_ACCESS or UNSAFE permissions
58,anyhow  we were made to sit in room and the hr gave a brief introduction about the software testing...then he gave n object to be tested...
2342,ROLLBACK retracts any of the changes resulting from the SQL statements in the transaction.

1689,Answer 10: (Moment he said this mind was like ok dude I'm Leaving. I stared at them with blank eyes.) They said do you need a moment? I said yes sir  that will be great. Actually this is my first interviewed and i'm very nervous  I didn't sit for any interview during my graduation. They asked why so? I started to answer but couldn't phrase words correctly and I apologised. They said there was nothing to apologise for and that it was quite natural. Somehow managed to say that back then i wasn't ready for an interview as i didn't have enough knowledge and that things would have been more worse than this(pointing to the blank paper). Then I looked at the formula again and couldn't even figure out how I would store the actual values and the measured ones. I confessed this by saying  Sir My mind if totally blank and I can't even think of how I'm supposed to store all the values. He then helped me by reminding me of arrays. I then somehow coded it in c which was incorrect and he pointed that out.  Then asked me to code the same incorrect one in Python but with proper syntax  which I managed somehow. Then asked if dictionaries are more useful for this scenario as we could keep the values as key and their error as values. I said I would prefer arrays as we need to traverse the entire thing both for errors and the values.
127,68. A______ class is a class that represents a data structure that stores a number of data objects
2106,The SQL Writer service was introduced to handle access to the data files in SQL Server. It allows backup programs  like VSS  to function while SQL Server is still running.
2383,It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER. Table partitioning helps to run the report faster as data  is stored in the relevant partitions. Also table maintenance becomes easier.  Oracle  Informix  IBM DB2/390 supports table partitioning while SAP DB   Microsoft SQL Server  IBM DB2/400 do not support table portioning.
1376,14. There is an employer table with key fields as employer number data in every  n'th row are needed for a simple following queries will get required results.
