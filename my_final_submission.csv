Which layer in the osi model is concerned with printer buffering  etc: network/session/transport/..,Maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. When a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. They do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.,You are developing security policy for your SQL Servers and have all of the data entry clerks needing access to a series of tables. You create a Data Entry role and assign the proper permissions as well as add the users.

16,transaction,Database Management System,The On-line Redo Log is a set of tow or more on-line redo files that record all committed changes made to the database. Whenever a transaction is committed  the corresponding redo entries temporarily stores in redo log buffers of the SGA are written to an on-line redo log file by the background process LGWR. The on-line redo log files are used in cyclical fashion.,b)LogWriter(LGWR) :: LogWriter writes the redo log entries to disk. Redo Log data is generated in redo log buffer of SGA. As transaction commits and log buffer fills  LGWR writes log entries into a online redo log file.,This agent is tasked with reading the transaction log in transactional replication and moving those transactions that need to be replicated to the distributor.,Recovery is the process of applying redo logs to the database to roll it forward. One can roll-forward until a specific point-in-time (before the disaster occurred)  or roll-forward until the last transaction recorded in the log files. Sql> connect SYS as SYSDBA,COMMIT makes permanent the changes resulting from all SQL statements in the transaction. The changes made by the SQL statements of a transaction become visible to other user sessions transactions that start only after transaction is committed.,PARTLY AVAILABLE - Contains data from an unresolved transaction involving a distributed database.,Q- What is deadlock and blocking with respect to the transaction?,A) When Transaction data is loaded into InfoCube.,COMMIT makes permanent the changes resulting from all SQL statements in the transaction. The changes made by the SQL statements of a transaction become visible to other user sessions transactions that start only after transaction is committed.,B) Transactional Load Partitioning Improvement:
